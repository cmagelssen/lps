%Slalom racers rely on effective strategies for swift descent toÂ In alpine ski racing, the characteristics of courses and hence the technical and tactical demands on skiers vary with terrain incline and course setting Ref: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118119 In steep terrain courses are set turny by increaseing the gate offset and shortening gate distance to control speed, while in flat terrain, gate offsets are small and gate distance are longer to maintain speed. The terrain incline and its interplay with the course setting has major effects on the skiers kinematics and kinetics and hence the demands.
